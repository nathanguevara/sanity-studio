## 🌐 Connecting to a Frontend

To use the content from this Studio in a frontend (like Next.js or Astro):

1. Install the Sanity client:

```bash
npm install @sanity/client groq
```

2. Set up a client (`lib/sanity.js`):

```js
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client'

export const sanity = createClient({
  projectId: 'your_project_id',
  dataset: 'production',
  apiVersion: '2023-12-14',
  useCdn: true,
})
```

3. Query content in your frontend:

```js
const posts = await sanity.fetch(`*[_type == "post"]{title, slug}`)
```

4. (Optional) Use `@portabletext/react` to render rich content.
